          My name is Bryce, but you can call me Bruce if you'd like. I am an avid photographer and digital
          art creator. You can find some of both by checking out my portfolio page! If I'm not out adding to the
          beautiful collection of art here you cand find me fighting crime, warping between
          galaxies, or teaching material arts to the monks of Quebec. Yes you read that right, the monks
          of Quebec, Canada. The monks also frequently ask me to take pictures for them, but you won't find
          those on my website, they are monk exclusives.

                If you aren't that into photography, you can support me by dining at my sushi restaurant 'Just Business'.
                We keep it real professional there. None of that small talk when that waiter comes out to take your order.
                You come in, we sit you down, the waiter gets your order, we bring the food. Easy as that. If you try and
                initiate any small talk we will have to ask you to leave, because that's not what we do, we do 'Just Business'.

          Thanks again for visiting my photography website, I would like to leave you with one of my
          favorite quotes:<br>
          <em>"If the photographer is interested in the people in front of his lens,
            and if he is compassionate, it's already a lot. The instrument is
            not the camera but the photographer</em><br>
          - Eve Arnold
